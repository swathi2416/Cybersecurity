Hacking - gaining unauthorized access
ethical hacking-gaining unauthorized access with written concern
web application peneration/security testing
web page-ideas in written format
web site-collection of webpages
web application-where user interaction is high
web server-
Offensive(red) and defensive(blue)-soc(security operation )reverse engineering,both(purple)
3 type of hackers:
white hat(architecture of web application),black hat,grey hat
hactivism - social purpose
CIA-Confidentiality,Integrity,Availability
authentication-verifying someones indentification
3 factors: something u know,something u have,someyhing u are(fingerprint)
integrity-orginality 
athourization/access control-permission
conversion of original data to sifer data-encrpytion
breach-loss of control
event-any observable occurance
incident-whichs affects CIA
intrusion-security event
threat-possibility to damage
TOE-Target of Evaluation
Attacks:
ransomeware - focusing on microsoft os by encrypting the messages nd demaning the payment in 2017
botnets-done by bots focusing on online customers by changing their ip address
phising- social engineering attack , it is a difficult attack by cliking a link , downloading a document
chain of custody(forensic security)-prove in court about logs
logs-os logs,data logs,application level logs ,network logs
steps to treat a crime: identify the request,check the type of authorization,response should have awarness about each specific attacks
cryptography is atechnique used to hide the information(crpyto-hidden/secret)
types: symmetric/single key- only 2 people authorized people can access given by password
asymmetric/public/private key- many of them have the password to access
.bat and .exec window path

@echo off
start mspaint
start cmd

If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use-*&*
If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be-*echo password123>passwords*
Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be-*echo tryhackme>>passwords*
*LINUX IS USED IN:*
         CAR,ENTERTAINMENT,REGISTER IN SHOPS,TRAFFIC LIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE
*echo*== Output any text that we provide
*whoami* ==	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
what exists in the first place ==*ls*
DISPLAY THE CURRENT FILE == *cd*
CONCATENATION ==*cat
displays the full pathname of the current directory == *pwd*
a command used for searching specific values in content == *grep*
to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages we will use the command *"GoBuster"*

The *mkdir*command in Linux/Unix is a command-line utility that allows users to create new directories
*mv* COMMAND IS USED TO MOVE
mv .\sourcefilename .\destfilename\
*cp* - USED TO COPY THE FILE
Dns server works in port 53
lo- loop back-network interface
etho-ethernet0
vpn to break firewall,masking,encrypt the connection btw client and server,encryption/decryption
after vpn connect ip(like 10.10.10.2) will get changed by encryotion algorithm
encryption-clear text->cipher text
decryption-cipher text->clear text
encryption(2 way) and hashing(1 way)
md4 hash generator to get hash
brute force attack is all possible permutation and combination
finding password from txt document is called dictonary attack
