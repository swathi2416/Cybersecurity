vulnerability(weakness)
hashcat,brute force-password cracking tool
Attacks-cracking (using) hardware without permission,
RAT-Remote Access Trojan
securing the data, resources
safe gurading
controls:
phsical control
administrative control
logical control

Hacking - gaining unauthorized access
ethical hacking-gaining unauthorized access with written concern
web application peneration/security testing
web page-ideas in written format
web site-collection of webpages
web application-where user interaction is high
web server-
Offensive(red) and defensive(blue)-soc(security operation )reverse engineering,both(purple)
3 type of hackers:
white hat(architecture of web application),black hat,grey hat
hactivism - social purpose
CIA-Confidentiality,Integrity,Availability
authentication-verifying someones indentification
3 factors: something u know,something u have,someyhing u are(fingerprint)
integrity-orginality 
athourization/access control-permission
conversion of original data to sifer data-encrpytion
breach-loss of control
event-any observable occurance
incident-whichs affects CIA
intrusion-security event
threat-possibility to damage
TOE-Target of Evaluation
Attacks:
ransomeware - focusing on microsoft os by encrypting the messages nd demaning the payment in 2017
botnets-done by bots focusing on online customers by changing their ip address
phising- social engineering attack , it is a difficult attack by cliking a link , downloading a document
chain of custody(forensic security)-prove in court about logs
logs-os logs,data logs,application level logs ,network logs
steps to treat a crime: identify the request,check the type of authorization,response should have awarness about each specific attacks
cryptography is atechnique used to hide the information(crpyto-hidden/secret)
types: symmetric/private key- only 2 people authorized people can access given by password
asymmetric/public key- many of them have the password to access
.bat and .exec window path
simple attacks:
@echo off
start mspaint
start cmd
ipconfig --help
linux -c switch counts
windows -n switch no.of counts
network device permanent address is mac
ceaser cipher
DES-data encryption standard 56bit
3XDES
AES-128 bit,192bit,256 bit
DHCP-AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNS IP ADDRESS
DNS SERVER-CONVERTS DOMAIN NAME TO IP AND IP TO DOMAIN NAME
LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM RELEASED-*1991*
COMMAND USED FOR OUTPUT-*echo TEXT*
USERNAME LOGGED TO DEPLOYED LINUX MACHINE-*tryhackme*
If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use-*&*
If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be-*echo password123>passwords*
Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be-*echo tryhackme>>passwords*
*LINUX IS USED IN:*
         CAR,ENTERTAINMENT,REGISTER IN SHOPS,TRAFFIC LIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE
*echo*== Output any text that we provide
*whoami* ==	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
what exists in the first place ==*ls*
DISPLAY THE CURRENT FILE == *cd*
CONCATENATION ==*cd*
displays the full pathname of the current directory == *pwd*
a command used for searching specific values in content == *grep*
to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages we will use the command *"GoBuster"*
